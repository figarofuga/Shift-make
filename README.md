# Shift-make

The aim of this project is to create a simple and easy to use tool for creating and managing shift schedules. The tool should be able to handle multiple shifts, multiple employees and multiple locations. The tool should also be able to handle different types of shifts, such as day shifts, night shifts, and on-call shifts. 
Furthermore, this is my personal practice of python, polars and etc.
